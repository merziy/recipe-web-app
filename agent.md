## Code Style Guidelines

- **No narrative comments**: Do not add explanatory comments like "// Get the user data" or "/* This function handles authentication */". Code should be self-documenting.
- **No TODO comments**: Complete implementations without leaving TODO markers.

- **Clean commits**: Make focused, single-purpose changes without excessive commentary.
